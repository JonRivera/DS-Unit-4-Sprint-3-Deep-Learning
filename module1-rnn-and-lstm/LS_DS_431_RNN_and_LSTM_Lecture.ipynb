Python lists are a good elemental example - `[1, 2, 2, -1]` is a valid list, and is different from `[1, 2, -1, 2]`. The data structures we tend to use (e.g. NumPy arrays) are often built on this fundamental structure.\n",

    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "There's plenty more to \"traditional\" time series, but the latest and greatest technique for sequence data is recurrent neural networks. A recurrence relation in math is an equation that uses recursion to define a sequence - a famous example is the Fibonacci numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "$F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "For formal math you also need a base case $F_0=1, F_1=1$, and then the rest builds from there. But for neural networks what we're really talking about are loops:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Recurrent neural network](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5/Recurrent_neural_network_unfold.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The hidden layers have edges (output) going back to their own input - this loop means that for any time `t` the training is at least partly based on the output from time `t-1`. The entire network is being represented on the left, and you can unfold the network explicitly to see how it behaves at any given `t`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different units can have this \"loop\", but a particularly successful one is the long short-term memory unit (LSTM):\n",
    "\n",
    "![Long short-term memory unit](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/Long_Short-Term_Memory.svg/1024px-Long_Short-Term_Memory.svg.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a lot going on here - in a nutshell, the calculus still works out and backpropagation can still be implemented. The advantage (ane namesake) of LSTM is that it can generally put more weight on recent (short-term) events while not completely losing older (long-term) information.\n",
    "\n",
    "After enough iterations, a typical neural network will start calculating prior gradients that are so small they effectively become zero - this is the [vanishing gradient problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanishing_gradient_problem), and is what RNN with LSTM addresses. Pay special attention to the $c_t$ parameters and how they pass through the unit to get an intuition for how this problem is solved.\n",
    "\n",
    "So why are these cool? One particularly compelling application is actually not time series but language modeling - language is inherently ordered data (letters/words go one after another, and the order *matters*). [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks](https://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) is a famous and worth reading blog post on this topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our purposes, let's use TensorFlow and Keras to train RNNs with natural language. Resources:\n",
    "\n",
    "- https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/examples/imdb_lstm.py\n",
    "- https://keras.io/layers/recurrent/#lstm\n",
    "- http://adventuresinmachinelearning.com/keras-lstm-tutorial/\n",

       "'Here are some recent headlines from schools around the country: In Indiana, officials played a segment of a 911 call of a teacher in a panic during the Columbine High School shooting to students. In Ohio, officers fired blank shots during an active-shooter drill. In South Carolina, an officer dressed in black posed as an intruder on an unannounced drill. In Michigan, a school is spending $48 million on a renovation that includes curved hallways and hiding niches, in hopes of protecting students from a mass shooting. In Florida, a police officer arrested two 6-year-old students for misdemeanor battery. In Colorado, teachers received buckets and kitty litter for students to use as toilets in case of a prolonged school lockdown.\\n\\nMass shootings, meaning incidents with at least two deaths, in schools are horrifying. But it is highly unlikely that a child would ever witness one. Research indicates that some security measures brought in to make schools safer ‚Äî like realistic shooter trainings ‚Äî may be causing children more harm than good.\\n\\nIt is 10 times more likely that a student will die on the way to school.\\n\\nOur chances of dying in a fire are also much greater ‚Äî 1 in 1,500. But we don‚Äôt overreact.\\n\\nMore children have died from lightning strikes than from mass shootings in schools in the past 20 years. Still, we don‚Äôt obsess about them.\\n\\nExactly how common are school shootings?\\n\\nIn the two decades since Columbine, there have been 10 mass shootings in schools according to a recent analysis by James Alan Fox, a professor of criminology at Northeastern University who has been studying school violence for several decades. In total, 81 people have been killed, 64 of them students. That‚Äôs an average of four deaths per year, three of them students.\\n\\nEven one death is too many. But for perspective, 729 children committed suicide with a firearm in 2017, and 863 were victims of homicides by guns that year.\\n\\nSchool-age children killed by guns 729 suicides in 2017 863 homicides Average killed in school mass shootings each year since 1999 Sources: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; average students killed since 1999 by James Alan Fox, Northeastern University. School-age children killed by guns 729 suicides in 2017 863 homicides Average killed in school mass shootings each year since 1999 Sources: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; average students killed since 1999 by James Alan Fox, Northeastern University.

But very few studies have looked into the efficiency of these drills. One of them concluded that the practice can be helpful to teach students basic safety procedures. But to the author of the study, Jaclyn Schildkraut, an associate professor at the State University of New York at Oswego, there is no point in dramatizing the drills. ‚ÄúAll that causes is fear,‚Äù she said.\\n\\nRestaurants have 10 times as many homicides as schools. Why do we want to arm teachers and not wait staffs?\\n\\n‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a misunderstanding in where the dangers are,‚Äù said Dewey G. Cornell, a psychologist and professor at the University of Virginia. ‚ÄúKids are at far greater danger going to and from school, than they are in the classroom,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSchool counseling, academic support, that‚Äôs gonna do far more to keep our communities safe.‚Äù\\n\\nUnlike the United States, the other wealthy countries in the Group of Seven don‚Äôt do lockdown drills and rarely have school shootings. What is the United States doing that is so different from them?\\n\\nGun deaths per 100,000 12 United States 10 8 6 4 Other G7 countries 2 0 25 50 75 100 Guns per 100 people Sources: Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, Global Burden of Disease Study 2016; Small Arms Survey, 2017.

Now they‚Äôre steering the conversation on gun violence.\\n\\nSchool shootings are extraordinarily rare. Why is fear of them driving policy?\\n\\nPutting more cops in schools won‚Äôt make schools safer, and it will likely inflict a lot of harm'"
